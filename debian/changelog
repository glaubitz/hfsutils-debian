hfsutils (3.2.6-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add autoconf build dependency - since the offending file is an empty
    stamp file (./.stamp/configure), we can't fix the dependency by just
    updating the files in my build tree because the file won't show up in
    the diff.  I could just put a single character in the stamp file, and
    that might help, but that's a fragile fix IMO. (closes: #104628)

hfsutils (3.2.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't invoke configure in make clean.  This isn't as robust, but it
    calling configure there was killing autobuilders who clean as root,
    and hence create a config.log that they can't edit when they
    subsequently build as a normal user. (closes: #94099)
